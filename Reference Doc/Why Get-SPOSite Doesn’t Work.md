**Why `Get-SPOSite` Doesn't Work**
----------------------------------

-   **`Get-SPOSite`** is part of the **SharePoint Online Management Shell** (`Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell`).
-   It appears there are persistent issues with that module, likely due to conflicting versions or corrupted installations.
-   **PnP PowerShell** is a more modern and robust alternative for most SharePoint Online tasks.
